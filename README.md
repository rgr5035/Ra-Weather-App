## Usage

As a user, you can use the search text area to look up the U.S. city of your choice. Once the disired city is entered, the user will receive a snapshot of the current weather, as well as a five-day forecast. Once the user searches for a city, it is saved in an unordered list, where the user can click on previously searched cities to return to their specific weather conditions.
